# Welcome to the Infosec Forge
## A place to share, learn, build, and grow

My name is Jon Hatch and this is the beginning of the Infosec Forge, a website dedicated to chronicling my path through the cybersecurity industry. My project portfolio can be found at https://www.jmhatch.com. I hope you will join me on this journey of learning and discovery as I build skills and move forward in my cybersecurity journey.
